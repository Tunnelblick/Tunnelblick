Copyright (c) 2005-2008 Alon Bar-Lev <alon.barlev@gmail.com>

ABOUT
	PKCS#11 is published standard. PKCS#11 is the de-facto standard to access cryptographic
	devices.

	pkcs11-helper is a library that simplifies the interaction with PKCS#11
	providers for end-user applications.

FEATURES
	pkcs11-helper allows using multiple PKCS#11 providers at the same time, enumerating 
	available token certificates, or selecting a certificate directly by serialized id,
	handling card removal and card insert events, handling card re-insert to a different
	slot, supporting session expiration and much more all using a simple API.

	pkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since object attributes
	are usually vendor specific, and 99% of application need to access
	existing objects in order to perform signature and decryption.

COMPATIBILITY
	- The pkcs11-helper library is available in POSIX and WIN32 compliant systems.

	- The pkcs11-helper library should work with almost any PKCS#11 provider, since it
	  uses the minimum required features of the PKCS#11 standard.
