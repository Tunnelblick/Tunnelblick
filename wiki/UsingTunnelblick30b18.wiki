Tunnelblick is an OS X Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the OpenVPN free and open-source program, which maintains VPN "tunnels". It provides easy-to-use control of OpenVPN server and/or client connections. It is written in Cocoa, runs on OS X Tiger (10.4), Leopard (10.5), and Snow Leopard (10.6) when booted into 32-bit mode. It comes as a ready to use Universal 32-bit application with all necessary binaries and drivers, including OpenVPN and tun/tap. Tunnelblick is free software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

For more information, including wikis and a discussion group, see the [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/ Tunnelblick home page].

This document describes how to use Tunnelblick version 3.0b18.

*This document may be obsolete!* The latest versions of this document and related documents including release notes, FAQ, and instructions 
for building Tunnelblick from the source code may be found in the [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/w/list Tunnelblick Wiki].

==INSTALLING TUNNELBLICK==
To install Tunnelblick, first download it from the Downloads page, then double-click the downloaded .dmg file. An icon for a “Tunnelblick” disk will appear on the Desktop, and a new window similar to the following will appear:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-dmg.png

Drag Tunnelblick.app (which may be labeled “Tunnelblick” without the “.app”) and drop it on the shortcut to the Applications folder. This will copy the application from the .dmg into the Applications folder. You may then close the window and eject the “Tunnelblick” disk icon.

There is no need to install OpenVPN separately - the Tunnelblick application contains both the Tunnelblick GUI and OpenVPN. See the Tunnelblick release notes (or click "About…" in Tunnelblick) to determine the version of OpenVPN included with the version of Tunnelblick that you are using.

If you wish Tunnelblick to appear in the Dock, navigate to Applications, and drag and drop Tunnelblick to the Dock.

==UNINSTALLING TUNNELBLICK==
To uninstall Tunnelblick, move Tunnelblick.app from the Applications folder to the Trash. Other than the preferences and configuration files described in "File Locations", there are no other files installed -- OpenVPN, the tun/tap kernel extensions, and up/down scripts are contained within the Tunnelblick.app package and are loaded only when needed directly from there. Tunnelblick may store passphrases or passwords in the Keychain at the user's request.

==CONFIGURATION FILES==
Each tunnel to be opened by Tunnelblick needs an OpenVPN configuration file. Tunnelblick considers any file located in ~/Library/openvpn with an extension of .conf or .ovpn to be a configuration file, and presents each such file as a potential “connection”. (The "~" refers to your home folder.) Often these configuration files will be supplied to you. Refer to [http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/69-openvpn-21.html the OpenVPN documentation] for details about what the configuration file should contain. (Note that some OpenVPN options are available only on Windows.)

Tunnelblick monitors the folder that contains the configuration files. If a configuration file is added, the new configuration is available immediately without restarting Tunnelblick or disturbing existing connections. If a  configuration is removed from the folder, any connection using that configuration is immediately disconnected. To disable this behavior, use "doNotMonitorConfigurationFolder". (See the "Preferences" section.)

The configuration file may also be "shadow" copied to the /Library/Tunnelblick/username folder. This is done transparently for configuration files located on network volumes. The user should never manipulate this folder or its contents directly; Tunnelblick will do so automatically. (See "useShadowConfigurationFiles" in the "Preferences" section.)

If Tunnelblick's “Set nameserver” option is used:

    * Any “up” or “down” options in the configuration file will be ignored.
    * If any “user” or “group” options appear in the configuration file, DNS settings will not be restored when a tunnel is disconnected.

==FILE LOCATIONS==
Tunnelblick preferences are contained in ~/Library/Preferences/com.openvpn.tunnelblick.plist. (The “~” indicates your home folder.)

OpenVPN configuration files are stored in ~/Library/openvpn. Usually the key and certificate files are stored there, too.

Since these files are all located in the user's Library folder, they must be set up separately for each user.

"Shadow" copies of configuration files may also be located in /Library/Tunnelblick/username. (See "useShadowConfigurationFiles" in the "Preferences" section.)

Within the Tunnelblick.app application, client up/down scripts are located in Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources (see the “Set nameserver” checkbox in the “OpenVPN Log Window” section). To access Tunnelblick.app/Contents in the Finder, control-click Tunnelblick.app in the Applications folder, then click on “Show Package Contents”.

==THE FIRST TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN BY EACH USER==
When there are no configuration files in ~/Library/openvpn (which is usually the case the first time Tunnelblick is run by each user) the following screen will be displayed:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-welcome.png

If you click “Quit”, Tunnelblick will quit without doing anything. If you click “Continue”, Tunnelblick will create and save an example OpenVPN configuration file, ~/Library/openvpn/openvpn.conf, and then open it in TextEdit for you to modify. If you have an OpenVPN configuration file that you are supposed to use, copy its contents, paste them into this file (replacing the default contents), save, and exit TextEdit. Your configuration (named “openvpn.conf”) is all set. Tunnelblick changes the ownership of OpenVPN configuration files to root, so it is protected against unnoticed and possibly malicious changes.

If you have received key files or certificate files together with your personal configuration file, please make sure to put them in ~/Library/openvpn/ (or another location as specified by your network administrator). OpenVPN will try to locate the key files in this folder, unless absolute paths to them are specified in the configuration file.

==THE FIRST TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN ON A COMPUTER==
The first time Tunnelblick is run on a particular computer (but only the first time the first user runs it), it will display the following screen:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-password.png

Please enter the name and password of a computer administrator. Tunnelblick's imbedded OpenVPN needs root privileges because it needs to modify network settings by configuring new network devices, changing routes, and adding and removing nameservers. Because we don't want you to enter your administrator account name and password every time you start a VPN connection, Tunnelblick comes with a setuid root binary that allows it to do exactly one thing: start a VPN connection with super user rights. Tunnelblick needs your administrator account name password only on its first start after installation, so it can create this setuid root binary.

==THE SECOND TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN BY EACH USER==
The second time Tunnelblick is run by each user, a screen similar to the following will be displayed:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-check.png

Specify whether or not you wish to have Tunnelblick check for updates. Each time an update is available, you will be given a choice of whether to install the update or not.

==WHEN A CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES==
Whenever a configuration file changes, you will need to enter the name and password of a computer administrator. This is done as a security measure: because configuration files can contain references to scripts that run as root, they are owned by root and an administrator must grant permission to use them.

==NORMAL TUNNELBLICK OPERATION==
Once Tunnelblick has been started, you control it from the icon in the Status Bar at the top of your screen. The Tunnelblick icon is usually placed between the time and the Spotlight icon. When no VPN connection is active, the icon is dark, indicating a closed tunnel:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-closed.png

If you click on the icon, you'll see a drop down menu similar to the following:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-menu.png

There will be a “Connect” menu item for each .ovpn or .conf file in ~/Library/openvpn/. Click on one to establish the corresponding pre-configured VPN connection. To illustrate the connection being established, three dots will appear in the menu item, and the Tunnelblick icon will darken and lighten repeatedly. If the connection is successfully opened, the icon will change to show an open tunnel:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-open.png

You may be asked for a passphrase or username/password combination if key/certificate files are not being used. You can save your passphrase or password in Apple's Keychain by checking the appropriate checkbox.

The connection will be active as long as you do not end it or log out. Putting your computer to sleep or losing contact with the server (by lack of wlan signal, for example) will make Tunnelblick periodically try to re-establish the connection.

If a connection error occurs, or in the unlikely event of an interface crash, Tunnelblick will terminate the VPN tunnel and record the error in the Console Log.

Use “Disconnect” from the drop-down menu to close the VPN connection. Use “Quit” to close all open connections and quit the program and prevent Tunnelblick from starting itself at your next login at your computer.

If Tunnelblick is running when you logout (or your computer crashes, or is shut down or restarted), then Tunnelblick will be started automatically upon login. To stop Tunnelblick from being started automatically upon login, be sure to quit Tunnelblick before logging out, either by using the “Quit” command, or by using Command-Q (Apple-Q) when the “OpenVPN Log” or “About…” window is active. (Don't confuse this automatic launch of Tunnelblick upon login with the “Automatically connect on launch” option, which causes a connection to be established when Tunnelblick is started.)

==THE “OPENVPN LOG” WINDOW==
Click on the Tunnelblick icon in the Status Bar at the top of your screen between the time and the Spotlight icon then click on “Details…” to obtain details for all connections (open or closed). A window similar to the following will appear:

http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss/web/using-tunnelblick-details.png

There will be a tab for each connection (i.e., each .ovpn or .conf file), whether the connection is open or closed. Each tab contains a pane with the OpenVPN Log for the connection and two checkboxes that provide options for that connection:

    * “Automatically connect on launch” causes the connection to be opened when Tunnelblick is launched (started). “Automatically connect on launch” is unchecked by default.

    * “Set nameserver” causes scripts to be run before a connection is opened and after the connection is closed. The scripts, client.up.osx.sh and client.down.osx.sh, save and restore DNS nameserver information. The scripts are located in the Tunnelblick application package at Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources. “Set nameserver” is checked by default.
    
    When a connection is attempted, the script for “Set nameserver” saves the current DNS settings and removes DNS settings that were set by DHCP (manual DNS settings are _not_ removed). When a connection is disconnected (or if it fails to connect), the scripts restore the saved DNS settings. The scripts do not support the simultaneous use of two or more nameservers for different domains; custom up/down scripts must be used for this purpose.

In addition, the “OpenVPN Log” window contains four buttons:

    * “Clear log” clears the OpenVPN Log for the connection being displayed.

    * “Edit configuration” starts TextEdit with the configuration file containing the OpenVPN configuration for the connection being displayed so it can be edited. Since configuration files are owned by root, they may only be edited by computer administrators.

    * “Connect” opens the connection being displayed.

    * “Disconnect” closes the connection being displayed.

You may use the standard keyboard shortcuts in the "OpenVPN Log" window: Command-C, Command-X, and Command-V for copy, cut, and paste; and Command-A, Command-M, Command-W, and Command-Q to select all the text in the log that is currently being displayed, minimize the window to the dock, close the window, and quit the program.

==THE “ABOUT TUNNELBLICK” WINDOW==
Click on the Tunnelblick icon in the Status Bar at the top of your screen between the time and the Spotlight icon, then click on “About Tunnelblick…” to open a window with information about the versions of Tunnelblick and OpenVPN that are running and a link to the Tunnelblick website.

==THE "SET NAMESERVER" CHECKBOX AND DNS & WINS SETTINGS==
If you are using DHCP, wish to use DNS and WINS servers at the far end of the tunnel when connected, and the VPN server you are connecting to "pushes" DNS and WINS settings to your client, put a check in the "Set nameserver" checkbox. (This is the situation for most users.)

If you are using DHCP, wish to use your original DNS and WINS servers when connected, and the VPN server you are connecting to does not "push" DNS or WINS settings to your client, un-check the "Set nameserver" checkbox.

If you are using manual settings, different versions of OS X behave differently. This is due to a change in network behavior in Snow Leopard and is beyond the scope of this project to fix.

If you're using Leopard (10.5) or Tiger (10.4), then it is possible to use the VPN-server-supplied DNS and WINS settings *in addition to* your manual settings by checking the "Set nameserver" box. However, your manual settings will always take precedence over any VPN server-supplied settings.  If "Set nameserver" is un-checked, you will continue to use only your manually-configured settings and any VPN server-supplied settings will be ignored.

If you are using Snow Leopard (10.6), then your manually-configured DNS and WINS settings will *always* be used, and no aggregation of configurations will be performed.

 * If you set your DNS servers manually, then regardless of the state of the "Set nameserver" box, your manual DNS servers will always be the only ones used.

 * If you set your Search Domain(s) manually, then regardless of the state of the "Set nameserver" box, your manual Search Domains will always be the only ones used.

 * If you set your WINS servers manually, then regardless of the state of the "Set nameserver" box, your manual WINS servers will always be the only ones used.

 * Each of these settings is independent of the others: if "Set nameserver" is checked, those settings not configured manually will be replaced by the settings obtained from the VPN server.  If "Set nameserver" is not checked, then as with Leopard/Tiger, no DNS/WINS settings will be applied.

*If your situation is not described above* (e.g., if you use manual DNS settings and wish to use DNS servers at the far end of a tunnel when connected, or you wish to use the OS X ability to use different nameservers for different domains), you must create your own up/down scripts and un-check the "Set nameserver" checkbox.

==USING MORE THAN ONE VPN CONNECTION==
You can put more than one .ovpn or .conf file together with its key and/or certificate files into the ~/Library/openvpn folder. Tunnelblick interprets each .ovpn or .conf file in the ~/Library/openvpn folder as a configuration file for a different connection; each of the connections will be available in the drop down menu and shown as a separate tab in the “OpenVPN Log” window.

==USING MORE THAN ONE VPN CONNECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY==
Tunnelblick can maintain multiple simultaneous open connections to different VPNs.

However, this is for experts only:

    * If you use “Set nameserver” (which uses standard scripts to save/change/restore DNS resolution data), on one or more connections your DNS settings may not be saved and restored properly and DNS might or might not work. It depends on the order in what DNS settings you want to use and which connections are opened and closed. Connections may close and be reopened because of communications errors over which you have no control, which can cause unpredictable results. Not recommended.
    * If you don't use “Set nameserver”, and your customized configuration files are suitably written to work together with custom scripts, things can work. But if you don't handle the DNS and routing settings properly, lots of things could go wrong. So this isn't recommended either unless you really know what you're doing and have a NEED to connect to multiple VPNs simultaneously.
    * VPN administrators might not be happy that you are connecting their networks together. Most VPN client software limits you to a single connection, probably for that reason.

==AUTOMATICALLY STARTING TUNNELBLICK UPON LOGIN==
Tunnelblick was designed as a persistent menu icon that survives reboots. To this end, it inserts itself into the login items when it is started and only removes itself from the login items when you choose Quit from the menu or Command-Q from the “OpenVPN Log” window. So if you just log out, shut down, or restart your computer, or it crashes, the next time you log in, Tunnelblick will automatically start. If you do not want Tunnelblick to start automatically, quit Tunnelblick before you log out, shut down, or restart.

==AUTOMATICALLY OPENING A VPN CONNECTION WHEN TUNNELBLICK STARTS==
You can specify that a connection automatically be opened when Tunnelblick starts by putting a check in the “Automatically connect on launch” checkbox for that connection. The checkbox is located on the connection's tab in the “OpenVPN Log” window.

==PREFERENCES==
There is not yet a GUI for Tunnelblick's preferences.

They are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.openvpn.tunnelblick.plist and can be inspected and modified with the “defaults” terminal command, which is documented on the [http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/defaults.1.html defaults man page]. Example: to set the “showAllDurations” preference, the command would be:

     defaults write com.openvpn.tunnelblick showAllDurations 1

Preferences can also be inspected and edited with the “Property List Editor”, which is a small part of the free [http://developer.apple.com/technology/Xcode.html Developer Tools] available from Apple (a free Apple Developer Connection membership is required). The Developer Tools are a very large (over 900MB download) suite of programs for developing software for Macs and iPhones.

Tunnelblick uses the following preferences for each user:

*useShadowConfigurationFiles*
If is set, each configuration file will be copied to a "shadow" configuration file in the /Library/Tunnelblick/username folder. The copy will be owned by root with permissions 0644 (the same as a normal configuration file). Shadow copies are automatically used after getting the user's permission (even without this preference being set) if the configuration file is located on a network volume. This preference allows home folders to be configured so as to prohibit ownership of any file by root.

*doNotMonitorConfigurationFolder*
If set, Tunnelblick will not monitor changes to ~/Library/openvpn, which means that you will have to shut down and restart Tunnelblick for new configuration files to be recognized. This is normally used only for network volumes. The default is cleared. Note that an updated configuration file will be loaded whenever a connection is made, regardless of this preference.

*placeIconInStandardPositionInStatusBar*
If set, Tunnelblick will place the icon in the standard position in the Status Bar, to the left of all other icons. If cleared and the system supports it, an undocumented system method is used to force the icon to be between the time and the Spotlight icon. The default is cleared.

*skipWarningAboutSimultaneousConnections*
If set, the user checked the "Do not show this warning again" checkbox when being warned about multiple simultaneous connections. The default is cleared.

*SUEnableAutomaticChecks*
If set, causes Tunnelblick to check for updates periodically. This is set or cleared depending on the user's response the second time Tunnelblick is run.

*SUSendProfileInfo*
Set if the user agreed to send anonymous information about the system configuration to Tunnelblick. The default is cleared.

*SUHasLaunchedBefore*
Set if Tunnelblick has been run for this user. (The "Check for updates automatically" question is asked only the second time Tunnelblick is run.)

*SULastCheckTime*
The date and time Tunnelblick last checked for updates.

*detailsWindowFrame*
The size and position of the “OpenVPN Log” window when it was last closed.

*detailsWindowFrameVersion*
The version of Tunnelblick that saved the detailsWindowFrame preference.

For each configuration file in ~/Library/openvpn, some or all of the following preferences may appear:
(“ZZZ” is the name of the configuration file.)

*ZZZuseDNS*
Corresponds to the configuration's “Set nameserver” checkbox. The default is set.

*ZZZautoConnect*
Corresponds to the configuration's “Automatically connect on launch” checkbox. The default is cleared.

*ZZZauthUsername*
The username associated with the configuration.

*ZZZusernameIsSet*
True if the username associated with the configuration has been set.

==COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE==
Tunnelblick also contains openvpnstart, an OS X command line interface to OpenVPN which provides a scriptable way to create and destroy OpenVPN tunnels. openvpnstart is located in Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources.

*openvpnstart   start   conf‑path   port  ` [` use‑scripts  ` [` skip‑script‑security `[` use-alt-config `]`   `]`   `]`*
     Creates an OpenVPN connection.
      	* *conf‑path* is the path to the .ovpn or .conf file which describes the connection.
      	* *port* is the port to use when creating the connection.
      	* *use‑scripts* is 1 to indicate that the “client.up.osx.sh” and “client.down.osx.sh” scripts should be called before the connection is created and after it is destroyed, respectively. 0 (the default) indicates the scripts should not be called.
      	* *skip‑script‑security* is 1 to indicate that the "--script-security 2" arguments should not be sent to OpenVPN. 0 (the default) indicates the arguments should be sent. ("--script-security 2" is available only on OpenVPN versions 2.1_rc9 and later.)
      	* *use-alt-config* is 1 to indicate that the configuration file to be used is located in the alternate location, the /Library/Tunnelblick/username folder. Certificates and keys are always assumed to be located in the normal configuration folder, ~/Library/openvpn.
        
*openvpnstart   kill   process‑id*
     Destroys an OpenVPN process (and closes any open connection it is managing).
      	* *process‑id* 	is the process number of the OpenVPN process which is managing the connection that should be destroyed.

*openvpnstart   killall*
     Destroys all OpenVPN processes (if any) and closes any open connections. If more than one processe is destroyed, a message with the number destroyed is output.

*openvpnstart   OpenVPNInfo*
     Invokes OpenVPN with no arguments, resulting in a the output of OpenVPN version and usage information.
