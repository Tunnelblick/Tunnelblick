<p class="p1"><b>Tunnelblick Advanced Settings Window</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Tunnelblick's Advanced Settings Window contains less-used settings for the configuration that is selected in the VPN Details Window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Most users do not need to change the settings in this window.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This window has two tabs. One tab contains advanced controls for when Tunnelblick is connecting or disconnecting the configuration; the other tab contains controls that are used while a connection is active.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Connecting and Disconnecting Tab</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Each setting in this tab is controlled by a checkbox:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Scan configuration file for problems before connecting</b>. When checked, Tunnelblick will scan the OpenVPN configuration file for problems before each attempt at connecting.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Use Tunnelblick tun/tap drivers</b>: Tunnelblick contains its own tun/tap drivers. When checked, Tunnelblick will load the appropriate driver before attempting to make a connection if the driver is not already loaded. The driver will be unloaded until all configurations using the driver have been disconnected.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Flush DNS cache after connecting or disconnecting</b>. When checked, Tunnelblick will flush the system's DNS cache after connecting and after disconnecting. This allows the system to use the appropriate DNS settings while the VPN connection is active and after it is disconnected.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Prepend domain name to search domains</b>: <em>This checkbox is only available when the default DNS/WINS setting of 'Set nameserver' is selected.</em> When checked, Tunnelblick will add the domain name to the <u>start</u> of the search domain list if the list has not been specified manually. If the search domain list has been specified manually (in the Network System Preference Advanced window DNS tab), then nothing is done. When not checked on OS X 10.4 and 10.5, the domain name is added to the <u>end</u> of the search domains list. When not checked on OS X 10.6 and higher, the domain name replaces the search domains list unless search domains were entered manually, in which case nothing is done.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Two checkboxes control what Tunnelblick does when a system "Fast User Switch" occurs:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Disconnect when user switches out</b>. When checked, Tunnelblick will disconnect the configuration when the user is switched out.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Reconnect when user switches in</b>. When checked, Tunnelblick will reconnect the configuration when the user is switched back in, if the configuration was connected before the user switched out.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>While Connected Tab</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This tab contains a checkbox to control whether or not the network settings are monitored for changes while a connection is active.</p>
<p class="p3">It also contains two sets of actions that will be taken when particular network settings change in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>When change to pre-VPN value</b>. These actions are taken when a network setting changes to the value it was before the VPN was established.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>When changes to anything else</b>. These actions are taken when a network setting changes to any other value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">One of three actions may be selected for each change:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Ignore</b>. The network setting change will be ignored.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Restore</b>. The network setting will be restored to the value it had after establishing the VPN.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Restart connection</b>. The network setting change will cause the connection to be restarted.</li>
</ul>
