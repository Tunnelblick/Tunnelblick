 <p><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/tb-logo.png"> </p><p>Tunnelblick
is an OS X Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the OpenVPN free and
open-source program, which maintains VPN "tunnels". It provides
easy-to-use control of OpenVPN server and/or client connections. It is
written in Cocoa, runs on OS X Tiger (10.4), Leopard (10.5), and Snow
Leopard (10.6) when booted into 32-bit mode. It comes as a ready to use
Universal 32-bit application with all necessary binaries and drivers,
including OpenVPN and tun/tap. Tunnelblick is free software licensed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2. </p><p>For more information, including wikis and a discussion group, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/" rel="nofollow">Tunnelblick home page</a>. </p><p>This document describes how to use Tunnelblick version 3.0b18 and was last modified 2009-09-23. </p><p><strong>This document may be obsolete!</strong>

install Tunnelblick, first download it from the Downloads page, then
double-click the downloaded .dmg file. An icon for a &ldquo;Tunnelblick&rdquo; disk
will appear on the Desktop, and a new window similar to the following
will appear: </a></p><p><a name="INSTALLING_TUNNELBLICK"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-dmg.png"> </a></p><p><a name="INSTALLING_TUNNELBLICK">Drag
Tunnelblick.app (which may be labeled &ldquo;Tunnelblick&rdquo; without the &ldquo;.app&rdquo;)
and drop it on the shortcut to the Applications folder. This will copy
the application from the .dmg into the Applications folder. You may
then close the window and eject the &ldquo;Tunnelblick&rdquo; disk icon. </a></p><p><a name="INSTALLING_TUNNELBLICK">There
is no need to install OpenVPN separately - the Tunnelblick application
contains both the Tunnelblick GUI and OpenVPN. See the Tunnelblick
release notes (or click "About…" in Tunnelblick) to determine the
version of OpenVPN included with the version of Tunnelblick that you
are using. </a></p><p><a name="INSTALLING_TUNNELBLICK">If you wish Tunnelblick to appear in the Dock, navigate to Applications, and drag and drop Tunnelblick to the Dock. </a></p><h2><a name="UNINSTALLING_TUNNELBLICK">UNINSTALLING TUNNELBLICK</a></h2><p><a name="UNINSTALLING_TUNNELBLICK">To
uninstall Tunnelblick, move Tunnelblick.app from the Applications
folder to the Trash. Other than the preferences and configuration files
described in "File Locations", there are no other files installed --
OpenVPN, the tun/tap kernel extensions, and up/down scripts are
contained within the Tunnelblick.app package and are loaded only when
needed directly from there. Tunnelblick may store passphrases or
passwords in the Keychain at the user's request. </a></p><h2><a name="CONFIGURATION_FILES">CONFIGURATION FILES</a></h2><p><a name="CONFIGURATION_FILES">Each
tunnel to be opened by Tunnelblick needs an OpenVPN configuration file.
Tunnelblick considers any file located in ~/Library/openvpn with an
extension of .conf or .ovpn to be a configuration file, and presents
each such file as a potential &ldquo;connection&rdquo;. (The "~" refers to your
home folder.) Often these configuration files will be supplied to you.
Refer to </a><a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/69-openvpn-21.html" rel="nofollow">the OpenVPN documentation</a> for details about what the configuration file should contain. (Note that some OpenVPN options are available only on Windows.) </p><p>Tunnelblick
monitors the folder that contains the configuration files. If a
configuration file is added, the new configuration is available
immediately without restarting Tunnelblick or disturbing existing
connections. If a configuration is removed from the folder, any
connection using that configuration is immediately disconnected. To
disable this behavior, use "doNotMonitorConfigurationFolder". (See the
"Preferences" section.) </p><p>The configuration file may also be
"shadow" copied to the /Library/Tunnelblick/username folder. This is
done transparently for configuration files located on network volumes.
The user should never manipulate this folder or its contents directly;
Tunnelblick will do so automatically. (See
"useShadowConfigurationFiles" in the "Preferences" section.) </p><p>If Tunnelblick's &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; option is used: </p><ul><li>Any &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo; options in the configuration file will be ignored. </li><li>If
any &ldquo;user&rdquo; or &ldquo;group&rdquo; options appear in the configuration file, DNS
settings will not be restored when a tunnel is disconnected. </li></ul><h2><a name="FILE_LOCATIONS">FILE LOCATIONS</a></h2><p><a name="FILE_LOCATIONS">Tunnelblick
preferences are contained in
~/Library/Preferences/com.openvpn.tunnelblick.plist. (The &ldquo;~&rdquo; indicates
your home folder.) </a></p><p><a name="FILE_LOCATIONS">OpenVPN configuration files are stored in ~/Library/openvpn. Usually the key and certificate files are stored there, too. </a></p><p><a name="FILE_LOCATIONS">Since these files are all located in the user's Library folder, they must be set up separately for each user. </a></p><p><a name="FILE_LOCATIONS">"Shadow"
copies of configuration files may also be located in
/Library/Tunnelblick/username. (See "useShadowConfigurationFiles" in
the "Preferences" section.) </a></p><p><a name="FILE_LOCATIONS">Within
the Tunnelblick.app application, client up/down scripts are located in
Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources (see the &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; checkbox
in the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log Window&rdquo; section). To access
Tunnelblick.app/Contents in the Finder, control-click Tunnelblick.app
in the Applications folder, then click on &ldquo;Show Package Contents&rdquo;. </a></p><h2><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER">THE FIRST TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN BY EACH USER</a></h2><p><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER">When
there are no configuration files in ~/Library/openvpn (which is usually
the case the first time Tunnelblick is run by each user) the following
screen will be displayed: </a></p><p><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-welcome.png"> </a></p><p><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER">If
you click &ldquo;Quit&rdquo;, Tunnelblick will quit without doing anything. If you
click &ldquo;Continue&rdquo;, Tunnelblick will create and save an example OpenVPN
configuration file, ~/Library/openvpn/openvpn.conf, and then open it in
TextEdit for you to modify. If you have an OpenVPN configuration file
that you are supposed to use, copy its contents, paste them into this
file (replacing the default contents), save, and exit TextEdit. Your
configuration (named &ldquo;openvpn.conf&rdquo;) is all set. Tunnelblick changes
the ownership of OpenVPN configuration files to root, so it is
protected against unnoticed and possibly malicious changes. </a></p><p><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER">If
you have received key files or certificate files together with your
personal configuration file, please make sure to put them in
~/Library/openvpn/ (or another location as specified by your network
administrator). OpenVPN will try to locate the key files in this
folder, unless absolute paths to them are specified in the
configuration file. </a></p><h2><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_ON_A_COMPUTER">THE FIRST TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN ON A COMPUTER</a></h2><p><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_ON_A_COMPUTER">The
first time Tunnelblick is run on a particular computer (but only the
first time the first user runs it), it will display the following
screen: </a></p><p><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_ON_A_COMPUTER"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-password.png"> </a></p><p><a name="THE_FIRST_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_ON_A_COMPUTER">Please
enter the name and password of a computer administrator. Tunnelblick's
imbedded OpenVPN needs root privileges because it needs to modify
network settings by configuring new network devices, changing routes,
and adding and removing nameservers. Because we don't want you to enter
your administrator account name and password every time you start a VPN
connection, Tunnelblick comes with a setuid root binary that allows it
to do exactly one thing: start a VPN connection with super user rights.
Tunnelblick needs your administrator account name password only on its
first start after installation, so it can create this setuid root
binary. </a></p><h2><a name="THE_SECOND_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER">THE SECOND TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN BY EACH USER</a></h2><p><a name="THE_SECOND_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER">The second time Tunnelblick is run by each user, a screen similar to the following will be displayed: </a></p><p><a name="THE_SECOND_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-check.png"> </a></p><p><a name="THE_SECOND_TIME_TUNNELBLICK_IS_RUN_BY_EACH_USER">Specify
whether or not you wish to have Tunnelblick check for updates. Each
time an update is available, you will be given a choice of whether to
install the update or not. </a></p><h2><a name="WHEN_A_CONFIGURATION_FILE_CHANGES">WHEN A CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES</a></h2><p><a name="WHEN_A_CONFIGURATION_FILE_CHANGES">Whenever
a configuration file changes, you will need to enter the name and
password of a computer administrator. This is done as a security
measure: because configuration files can contain references to scripts
that run as root, they are owned by root and an administrator must
grant permission to use them. </a></p><h2><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">NORMAL TUNNELBLICK OPERATION</a></h2><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">Once
Tunnelblick has been started, you control it from the icon in the
Status Bar at the top of your screen. The Tunnelblick icon is usually
placed between the time and the Spotlight icon. When no VPN connection
is active, the icon is dark, indicating a closed tunnel: </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-closed.png"> </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">If you click on the icon, you'll see a drop down menu similar to the following: </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-menu.png"> </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">There
will be a &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; menu item for each .ovpn or .conf file in
~/Library/openvpn/. Click on one to establish the corresponding
pre-configured VPN connection. To illustrate the connection being
established, three dots will appear in the menu item, and the
Tunnelblick icon will darken and lighten repeatedly. If the connection
is successfully opened, the icon will change to show an open tunnel: </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-open.png"> </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">You
may be asked for a passphrase or username/password combination if
key/certificate files are not being used. You can save your passphrase
or password in Apple's Keychain by checking the appropriate checkbox. </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">The
connection will be active as long as you do not end it or log out.
Putting your computer to sleep or losing contact with the server (by
lack of wlan signal, for example) will make Tunnelblick periodically
try to re-establish the connection. </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">If
a connection error occurs, or in the unlikely event of an interface
crash, Tunnelblick will terminate the VPN tunnel and record the error
in the Console Log. </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">Use
&ldquo;Disconnect&rdquo; from the drop-down menu to close the VPN connection. Use
&ldquo;Quit&rdquo; to close all open connections and quit the program and prevent
Tunnelblick from starting itself at your next login at your computer. </a></p><p><a name="NORMAL_TUNNELBLICK_OPERATION">If
Tunnelblick is running when you logout (or your computer crashes, or is
shut down or restarted), then Tunnelblick will be started automatically
upon login. To stop Tunnelblick from being started automatically upon
login, be sure to quit Tunnelblick before logging out, either by using
the &ldquo;Quit&rdquo; command, or by using Command-Q (Apple-Q) when the &ldquo;OpenVPN
Log&rdquo; or &ldquo;About…&rdquo; window is active. (Don't confuse this automatic launch
of Tunnelblick upon login with the &ldquo;Automatically connect on launch&rdquo;
option, which causes a connection to be established when Tunnelblick is
started.) </a></p><h2><a name="THE_&ldquo;OPENVPN_LOG&rdquo;_WINDOW">THE &ldquo;OPENVPN LOG&rdquo; WINDOW</a></h2><p><a name="THE_&ldquo;OPENVPN_LOG&rdquo;_WINDOW">Click
on the Tunnelblick icon in the Status Bar at the top of your screen
between the time and the Spotlight icon then click on &ldquo;Details…&rdquo; to
obtain details for all connections (open or closed). A window similar
to the following will appear: </a></p><p><a name="THE_&ldquo;OPENVPN_LOG&rdquo;_WINDOW"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-details.png"> </a></p><p><a name="THE_&ldquo;OPENVPN_LOG&rdquo;_WINDOW">There
will be a tab for each connection (i.e., each .ovpn or .conf file),

can put more than one .ovpn or .conf file together with its key and/or
certificate files into the ~/Library/openvpn folder. Tunnelblick
interprets each .ovpn or .conf file in the ~/Library/openvpn folder as
a configuration file for a different connection; each of the
connections will be available in the drop down menu and shown as a
separate tab in the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window. </a></p><h2><a name="USING_MORE_THAN_ONE_VPN_CONNECTION_SIMULTANEOUSLY">USING MORE THAN ONE VPN CONNECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY</a></h2><p><a name="USING_MORE_THAN_ONE_VPN_CONNECTION_SIMULTANEOUSLY">Tunnelblick can maintain multiple simultaneous open connections to different VPNs. </a></p><p><a name="USING_MORE_THAN_ONE_VPN_CONNECTION_SIMULTANEOUSLY">However, this is for experts only: </a></p><ul><li><a name="USING_MORE_THAN_ONE_VPN_CONNECTION_SIMULTANEOUSLY">If
you use &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; (which uses standard scripts to
save/change/restore DNS resolution data), on one or more connections
your DNS settings may not be saved and restored properly and DNS might
or might not work. It depends on the order in what DNS settings you
want to use and which connections are opened and closed. Connections
may close and be reopened because of communications errors over which
you have no control, which can cause unpredictable results. Not
recommended. </a></li><li><a name="USING_MORE_THAN_ONE_VPN_CONNECTION_SIMULTANEOUSLY">If
you don't use &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo;, and your customized configuration files
are suitably written to work together with custom scripts, things can
work. But if you don't handle the DNS and routing settings properly,
lots of things could go wrong. So this isn't recommended either unless
you really know what you're doing and have a NEED to connect to
multiple VPNs simultaneously. </a></li><li><a name="USING_MORE_THAN_ONE_VPN_CONNECTION_SIMULTANEOUSLY">VPN
administrators might not be happy that you are connecting their
networks together. Most VPN client software limits you to a single
connection, probably for that reason. </a></li></ul><h2><a name="AUTOMATICALLY_STARTING_TUNNELBLICK_UPON_LOGIN">AUTOMATICALLY STARTING TUNNELBLICK UPON LOGIN</a></h2><p><a name="AUTOMATICALLY_STARTING_TUNNELBLICK_UPON_LOGIN">Tunnelblick
was designed as a persistent menu icon that survives reboots. To this
end, it inserts itself into the login items when it is started and only
removes itself from the login items when you choose Quit from the menu
or Command-Q from the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window. So if you just log out,
shut down, or restart your computer, or it crashes, the next time you
log in, Tunnelblick will automatically start. If you do not want
Tunnelblick to start automatically, quit Tunnelblick before you log

If is set, each configuration file will be copied to a "shadow"
configuration file in the /Library/Tunnelblick/username folder. The
copy will be owned by root with permissions 0644 (the same as a normal
configuration file). Shadow copies are automatically used after getting
the user's permission (even without this preference being set) if the
configuration file is located on a network volume. This preference
allows home folders to be configured so as to prohibit ownership of any
file by root. </p><p><strong>doNotMonitorConfigurationFolder</strong>
If set, Tunnelblick will not monitor changes to ~/Library/openvpn,
which means that you will have to shut down and restart Tunnelblick for
new configuration files to be recognized. This is normally used only
for network volumes. The default is cleared. Note that an updated
configuration file will be loaded whenever a connection is made,
regardless of this preference. </p><p><strong>placeIconInStandardPositionInStatusBar</strong>
If set, Tunnelblick will place the icon in the standard position in the
Status Bar, to the left of all other icons. If cleared and the system
supports it, an undocumented system method is used to force the icon to
be between the time and the Spotlight icon. The default is cleared. </p><p><strong>skipWarningAboutSimultaneousConnections</strong>
If set, the user checked the "Do not show this warning again" checkbox
when being warned about multiple simultaneous connections. The default
is cleared. </p><p><strong>SUEnableAutomaticChecks</strong> If set,
causes Tunnelblick to check for updates periodically. This is set or
cleared depending on the user's response the second time Tunnelblick is
run. </p><p><strong>SUSendProfileInfo</strong> Set if the user agreed to send anonymous information about the system configuration to Tunnelblick. The default is cleared. </p><p><strong>SUHasLaunchedBefore</strong>
Set if Tunnelblick has been run for this user. (The "Check for updates
automatically" question is asked only the second time Tunnelblick is
run.) </p><p><strong>SULastCheckTime</strong> The date and time Tunnelblick last checked for updates. </p><p><strong>detailsWindowFrame</strong> The size and position of the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window when it was last closed. </p><p><strong>detailsWindowFrameVersion</strong> The version of Tunnelblick that saved the detailsWindowFrame preference. </p><p>For
each configuration file in ~/Library/openvpn, some or all of the
following preferences may appear: (&ldquo;ZZZ&rdquo; is the name of the
