# This script downloads and installs new versions of the GNU "autotools" -- a set of
# command line tools that are obsolete in Xcode 3 and are missing from Xcode 4 and higher.
#
# It installs the tools to /usr/local/bin. It uses sudo to install because /usr/local/bin
# is a protected folder. So it must be run from an OS X account with administrator
# privileges. (Sudo will ask for the user's password once.)



# Version of each tool to download and install:

readonly autoconf_version="autoconf-2.69"
readonly automake_version="automake-1.15"
readonly libtool_version="libtool-2.4.5"

# You can check for the latest version of each tool by examining the following:
#     http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/autoconf
#     http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/automake
#     http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libtool
# If you wish to install different versions, modify the variables above.
# Note that it is possible (although unlikely) that later versions of the autotools may
# not work properly for the third party build process.



# Folder to which the tools are downloaded and in which the tools are built:

readonly downloads_folder_path=~/"Downloads"

# Note that if you modify this path, you should be sure to either have no spaces in the
# path or use double-quotes to enclose the path. If you use double-quotes with ~/, be sure
# the first double-quote follows the '~/'.



# URLs for downloading the tools:
readonly autoconf_url=http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/autoconf/${autoconf_version}.tar.gz
readonly automake_url=http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/automake/${automake_version}.tar.gz
readonly libtool_url=http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libtool/${libtool_version}.tar.gz
